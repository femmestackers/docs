And with the internet allowing the exchange of information at wildfire-pace, this app makes use of people’s passion for smoothies! It allows the users to view smoothie recipes from their favourite categories and post comments on what they think of them. It also allows users to post their recipes, so that others can try them and enjoy its goodness!
