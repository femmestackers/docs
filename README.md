 **Purpose**

  Smoothies have gained fame over the past years for a host of health benefits with the added bonus of being tasty!  And with the internet allowing the exchange of information at wildfire-pace, this app makes use of people’s passion for smoothies! It allows the users to view smoothie recipes from their favourite categories and post comments on what they think of them. It also allows users to post their recipes, so that others can try them and enjoy its goodness! We call this app “Smoothiverse” because we feel it offers the universe of smoothies in terms of variety.

### R4 User Stories
These are very brief, informal descriptions of the requirements of the website from the user’s point of view. They are usually written in the “As a 'type of' user, I want 'a feature' so that 'reason' format."
These User stories were created on 'CardboardIt' by using cards of different colours for the types of users.
We wrote user stories to get an idea of what features to develop in the app and to show refinements in the user stories that happen in the process of building the app
